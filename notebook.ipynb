I'm happy to see that my notes are useful for others who are starting out in data analysis and machine learning, and I hope that you will be able to get some inspiration from this kernel.\n",

    "As the kernel continues to grow it is branching out in more detail into the different data analysis steps. This adds more depth to the overall content, but it also makes the whole notebook rather extensive. If you're very new to this subject then I recommend to go through each section on it's own (e.g. by playing with a forked copy) rather than reading the whole thing in one go. Of course, for newbies I also recommend the excellent kernels featured in the [Titanic Tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic#tutorials). "

The first split can be followed up by additional ones to narrow down the decision criteria (based on the subset defined by each previous split).\n",

Following that, parameter *min_weight_fraction_leaf* is less biased towards dominating classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example: we fit a tree, determine its results (prediction: survived vs not survived), compute the residuals of this prediction vs the real survival numbers (all in the training data, of course), and then fit another tree to these residuals. This tree can now consider the full number of training samples for splitting a node at another feature, instead of having to deal with the decreased sample after the first original node (and the resulting impact of random fluctuations). This can be done again and again for n_estimator number of times.\n",

    "Instead of reducing the residuals (and the corresponding squared errors) Gradient Boosting focusses on minimising the *Loss Function* by training the classifier on the *gradient* of this function. The Loss Function describes how much the prediction is improved when shifting the predicted values by a certain amount. The method of *Gradient Decent* uses this Loss Function to iteratively move into the direction of its greatest decent (i.e. most negative first derivative). The step sizes can vary from iteration to iteration.\n",
